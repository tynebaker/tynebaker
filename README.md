## Hi there 👋
🌱 I'm the Owner, Wildlife Biologist, and Remote Detection Specialist at github.com/avianeco
 🐦🦗 *Learn more about my work at www.avianeco.com* 🦇🐸
 

👷‍♀️I'm posting R-scripts, Audacity macros, and other remote camera and bioacoustics data tools I use regularly.
      The goal is to open-source the tools I use daily to help other biologists and land stewards with audio-visual data management.
