## Hi there 👋
🌱 I'm the Owner, Wildlife Biologist, and Remote Detection Specialist [@avianeco](https://github.com/avianeco)

 
👷‍♀️I post R-scripts, Audacity macros, and other remote camera and bioacoustics data tools I use regularly.
      The goal is to open-source the tools I use daily to help other biologists and land stewards with audio-visual data management.
